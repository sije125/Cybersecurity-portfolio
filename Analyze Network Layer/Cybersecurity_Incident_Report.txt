You are tasked with analyzing the situation and determining which network protocol was affected during this incident. To start, 
you attempt to visit the website and you also receive the error “destination port unreachable.” To troubleshoot the issue, 
you load your network analyzer tool, tcpdump, and attempt to load the webpage again. To load the webpage, 
your browser sends a query to a DNS server via the UDP protocol to retrieve the IP address for the website's domain name; 
this is part of the DNS protocol. Your browser then uses this IP address as the destination IP for sending an HTTPS request 
to the web server to display the webpage  The analyzer shows that when you send UDP packets to the DNS server, 
you receive ICMP packets containing the error message: “udp port 53 unreachable.”

Part 1: Provide a summary of the problem found in the tcpdump log-
As part of the DNS protocol, the UDP protocol was used to contact the DNS server to retrieve the IP address 
for the domain name of yummyrecipesforme.com. The ICMP protocol was used to respond with an error message, 
indicating issues contacting the DNS server. The UDP message going from your browser to the DNS server is shown in the 
first two lines of every log event. The ICMP error response from the DNS server to your browser is displayed in the 
third and fourth lines of every log event with the error message, “udp port 53 unreachable.” Since port 53 is associated 
with DNS protocol traffic, we know this is an issue with the DNS server. Issues with performing the DNS protocol are 
further evident because the plus sign after the query identification number 35084 indicates flags with the UDP message 
and the “A?” symbol indicates flags with performing DNS protocol operations. Due to the ICMP error response message about port 53, 
it is highly likely that the DNS server is not responding. This assumption is further supported by the flags associated with the 
outgoing UDP message and domain name retrieval.

Part 2: Explain your analysis of the data and provide at least one cause of the incident.
The incident occurred today at 1:24 p.m. Customers notified the organization 
that they received the message “destination port unreachable” when they 
attempted to visit the website yummyrecipesforme.com. The cybersecurity 
team providing IT services to their client organization are currently 
investigating the issue so customers can access the website again. In our 
investigation into the issue, we conducted packet sniffing tests using 
tcpdump. In the resulting log file, we found that DNS port 53 was unreachable.
The next step is to identify whether the DNS server is down or traffic to port 
53 is blocked by the firewall. The DNS server might be down due to a 
successful Denial of Service attack or a misconfiguration.
